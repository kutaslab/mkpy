# Header data extraction uses the same YAML format as the header file 
#
# Every mkh5 data block has exactly one header.
#
# The header is a tree structure with branches ending in a dataum "leaf". 
#
# The header file defines branches and where to *set* the leaves. 
#
# The extraction file defines branches and where *get* those leaves. 
#
# Syntax:
# 
#    key:
#     value
#
# where value may be non-terminal or terminal 
#
#   * non-terminals:
#
#       key (string) for maps in the YAML header
#       index (0-based positive integer) for sequences in the YAML header
#
#    * terminal
#       column_name (string) in the event table for these terminal data in the YAML header
#
# In English ... mkh5 header information comes from two places:
#
#   1. the original dig header in the .crw file (from mdh)
#   2. the new YAML header (.yhdr) passed in when mkh5 converted the crw/log 
# We extract it the same way it went in ... via any of the info from
#  the mkh5 header the same way

# ---
name: dig  # extract name of the header ... should be path to a dblock

# extract participant to a column called dig_sub_id
subdesc: subdesc
expdesc: expdesc
   
# Example: 

---
name: runsheet   # a document name always

age: age      # Note 1: the column name can be the same as header key like this ...
SAT: sat_test # Note 2: but it doesn't have to be ... as in this case
mri_id: MR_ID

# if the branch specified doesn't exist or the data is missing the
# row(s) for that column will be empty
there_is_no_such_header_key_as_this: empty_col

# This extraction map aligns with the corresponding data in the YAML header.
# And again, the "leaf" here says which column to put the data into.
mood_VAS:
  pre:
    valence: mood_pre_valence  
    arousal: mood_pre_arousal
  mid:
    valence: mood_mid_valence
    arousal: mood_mid_arousal
  post:
    valence: mood_post_valence
    arousal: mood_post_arousal

# 1. To extract data that came from the .crw dig header.
#
#      - define a YAML document 
#      - specify which keys you want to extract 
#      - where the datum would be, instead put the name of the column
#        where it will be stored.
#
#
# 2. The YAML header (yhdr) allows additional information to be
#    included in the mkh5 header. To fish it back out for inclusion in
#    the event and epoch table do this.
#
#       - copy and paste the part of the YAML header file you want to extract
#       - replace each data value with the name of the column where you want it to appear
# 
#     Thats it.
#

# Wrinkle: sequences
#
# In YAML a sequence might look like this
# 
#    some_sequence:
#      - alpha
#      - beta
#      - gamma
#
#
#
#  For defining the branches/paths to sequence data, the indices of
#  the sequence i = 0, 1, 2 are promoted to keys and then work the
#  same way as the usual maps (except that order is preserved).

some_sequence:
  0: alpha
  1: beta
  2: gamma
