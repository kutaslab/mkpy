Around 2017 TPU adapted Python/Cython routines NJS had written for
reading and writing the compressed binary ERPSS data files while a
grad student at UCSD (https://github.com/rerpy/rerpy).  TPU
subsequently designed the ``mkh5`` EEG data interchange format and
wrote the first version of ``mkpy`` which included mkh5 CRUD, the code
tagger, event table, and epoch table utilities. In 2018 Andrey Portnoy
refactored and improved the original mkh5.py code base as events.py,
h5tools.py, added logging, and expanded and hardened the tests. In
2018 TPU wrote the ``mkh5viewer`` GUI, ``pygarv`` and the ``mkpy``
documentation.  This work was done in Marta Kutas' Cognitive
Electrophysiology Lab at UCSD with invaluable feedback and testing
throughout development by members of the Kutas lab and UCSD Cognitive
Science Department. This work was supported by NIH Grant NIH
R01HD22614 to MK.
